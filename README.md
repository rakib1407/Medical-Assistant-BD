# Medical-Assistant-BD  

This website is created for people in Bangladesh who need medical help but have difficulty traveling to hospitals or pharmacies. Especially for elderly, sick, or busy people who cannot go themselves, our service sends helpers to assist them. Users can book services like hospital visits, medicine delivery, or collecting medical reports through the website. In return, they pay a fee for the service. This platform provides affordable and convenient medical assistance digitally.
